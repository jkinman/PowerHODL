## How It Works

1. **Monitor** ETH/BTC ratio 24/7
2. **Detect** when ETH is unusually cheap or expensive vs BTC  
3. **Trade** automatically when opportunities arise
4. **Profit** from mean reversion patterns
5. **Accumulate** more BTC over time

### The Secret: Z-Score Mean Reversion

```
ETH/BTC ratio swings between extremes.
When it's too high → Sell ETH, Buy BTC
When it's too low → Buy ETH, Sell BTC
Always profit when it returns to normal.
```

**Current Signal**: `HOLD` (Z-Score: -0.74, waiting for -1.26 threshold)
